Graham Scan
===========

CLRS Ch. 33. Grahamâ€™s scan finds the smallest bounding polygon among a set of points!

basically, it finds the lowest (and then lowest left in case of tie) point and then does a counterclockwise rotational sweep to make sure that it gets each vertex, removing anything it comes across that require non-left turns. The result comes out like this:
